# Runs the RISC-V Architectural Certification Tests on the testbench, in
# parallel, and reports which passed.
#
# Each ACT ELF is self-checking: it ends by writing the EOC register with a pass
# or fail code (see sw/arch-test/rvmodel_macros.h), so the testbench's own
# pass/fail protocol is the verdict and nothing has to parse a signature.
# Failures listed in sw/arch-test/waivers.txt are reported as WAIVED instead.
#
# Like the other simulation flows, it runs inside the container that built the
# model, which needs a newer glibc than the host has:
#
#   make -C test/sw arch-test CVA6_CONFIG=<cfg>     # generate the ELFs
#   make -C test verilator-build CVA6_CONFIG=<cfg>  # the same <cfg>
#   oseda -2026.04 ./util/run-arch-tests.sh         # checks the two agree
