# Turns the tracer's `binary` output into a Perfetto trace showing what the
# software did: a flame chart of the call stack, the privilege level over time,
# a track of traps and interrupts, and an IPC counter.
#
#   ./build/Vtest +binary=prog.hex +trace_format=binary +trace_file=trace.bin
#   ./util/trace_to_perfetto.py trace.bin prog.elf -o trace.pftrace
#
# Then open trace.pftrace at https://ui.perfetto.dev.
#
# Everything this needs is already in the binary record, so it runs on a trace
# that has already been taken and changing what is plotted costs a re-run of the
# script. The fixed records parse with no work, they are in execution order, and
# the `class` byte carries what the instruction is, so no RISC-V decoding happens
# here.
#
# The whole file is loaded with numpy in one call and the per record work is
# vectorised, because a trace is one record per retired instruction while the
# points where anything changes are a small fraction of them. The dtype below is
# the one `read_trace.py`'s docstring gives.
#
# Frames are reconstructed from which symbol the pc falls in, which attributes
# the tail calls that are common at -O2 to the callee. The rules, in order:
#
#   - the record after a call (a jump that writes a link register) opens a frame
#   - a symbol already on the stack closes frames until it is on top, which also
#     recovers from returns that were missed
#   - any other change of symbol replaces the top frame, which is the tail call
#     case
#
# Traps open a frame of their own and `mret`/`sret` closes it, so a handler
# nests inside the interrupted function. The frame is named after the cause,
# which comes from the CSR records the tracer writes from version 3 on.
