# CVA6 instruction tracer

Writes one line per retired instruction, driven from the standard **RVFI** interface and usable
under Verilator as well as under event driven simulators.

The default format, `trace`, is plain text in fixed columns, made to be read in an editor. Other
formats reproduce the legacy
[`common/local/util/instr_tracer.sv`](../../../common/local/util/instr_tracer.sv), write spike's
commit log, or write fixed size records for tools; see *Output formats*.

## How it is put together

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [cva6tb_tracer.sv](cva6tb_tracer.sv) | Samples RVFI at commit and calls the DPI backend. No strings, classes or queues. |
| [cva6tb_tracer_dpi.h](cva6tb_tracer_dpi.h) | The DPI-C interface between the two halves. |
| [cva6tb_tracer.cc](cva6tb_tracer.cc) | Formats and writes the trace; owns the output file. |
| [rv_disasm.h](rv_disasm.h) / [rv_disasm.cc](rv_disasm.cc) | Self-contained RV32/RV64 decoder, with the legacy tracer's spelling. |
| [rv_disasm_spike.cc](rv_disasm_spike.cc) | The same instructions spelled as spike-dasm spells them. |
| [rv_format.h](rv_format.h) / [rv_format.cc](rv_format.cc) | The output formats and the factory that picks between them. |
| [rv_stats.h](rv_stats.h) / [rv_stats.cc](rv_stats.cc) | Optional end of run summary, written to its own file. |
| [rv_symbols.h](rv_symbols.h) / [rv_symbols.cc](rv_symbols.cc) | Symbol table and its ELF loader. |
| [rv_trigger.h](rv_trigger.h) / [rv_trigger.cc](rv_trigger.cc) | Start/stop conditions and the windows they delimit. |
| [vscode/](vscode/) | Syntax highlighting for the `trace` format in VS Code. |

All decoding, formatting and file I/O live on the C++ side, so the RTL half stays trivial and
the same backend works under Verilator, QuestaSim, VCS and Xcelium. Nothing links against
spike, fesvr or any other external library.

The tracer needs `cva6_rvfi`, which turns the core's `rvfi_probes_o` into RVFI proper. Both are
instantiated in [`cva6tb_soc.sv`](../cva6tb_soc.sv) behind `` `ifdef TARGET_TRACER ``, so a
default build elaborates neither and pays nothing.

## Using it

Tracing is a build-time option, because RVFI generation itself costs simulation time:

```sh
make verilator-build TRACER=1
make verilator-run   TRACER=1 HEXFILE=sw/out/hello.hex
```

The trace lands in `verilator/cva6tb_trace_hart_0.trace`. QuestaSim works the same way
(`make vsim-build TRACER=1`), with the DPI backend compiled by `vlog`.

RV32 configurations work too, with the test software rebuilt for the narrower width:

```sh
make verilator-build CVA6_CONFIG=cv32a6_imac_sv32 TRACER=1
make -C sw clean && make -C sw $PWD/sw/out/hello.hex \
  SW_FLAGS="-DOT_PLATFORM_RV32 -march=rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei -mabi=ilp32 -mstrict-align -O2 \
            -Wall -Wextra -static -ffunction-sections -ffreestanding -fdata-sections"
```

Runtime behaviour is controlled with plusargs. With make, the everyday ones are variables named
after them, and `SIM_ARGS` passes any plusarg; it comes first on the command line, so it takes
priority:

| Plusarg | Make variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `+notrace` | | — | Disable tracing in a build that has it compiled in |
| `+trace_file=<path>` | `TRACE_FILE` | `cva6tb_trace_hart_0.trace` | Output file; `.bin` for `binary`, `.txt` for the other formats |
| `+trace_format=<name>` | `TRACE_FORMAT` | `trace` | `trace`, `legacy`, `spike`, `rvfi` or `binary`, see *Output formats* |
| `+trace_verbose=<n>` | `TRACE_VERBOSE` | `0` | Detail level, see below |
| `+trace_stats=<path>` | `TRACE_STATS` | off | Write an end of run summary here |
| `+trace_start=<trigger>` | `TRACE_START` | open from the start | Open the trace window |
| `+trace_stop=<trigger>` | `TRACE_STOP` | never closes | Close it |
| `+trace_symbols=<elf>[,…]` | `TRACE_SYMBOLS` | off; with make, the program's ELF outside `legacy` | Annotate with symbol names, see *Symbol annotation* |
| `+trace_symbol_mode=<mode>` | | `header` | `header`, `inline` or `both` |
| `+trace_symbol_start=<trigger>` | | open from the start | Open the annotation window |
| `+trace_symbol_stop=<trigger>` | | never closes | Close it |

```sh
make verilator-run TRACER=1 HEXFILE=sw/out/hello.hex TRACE_VERBOSE=1
```

The simulation runs in `verilator/`. The Makefile makes the files it passes absolute; a file
named in `SIM_ARGS` is given as an absolute path, `$PWD/...` from `test/`.

### In another testbench

The tracer does not depend on this testbench, so an SoC that embeds CVA6 can put it in its own
one. One Bender target is needed and it is not `cva6tb`:

```sh
bender script ... -t tracer        # core/cva6_rvfi.sv and test/hw/tracer/cva6tb_tracer.sv
```

`-t cva6tb` would additionally compile `test/hw/cva6tb_*.sv` and make this testbench's
dependencies — its CLINT, its CLIC — relevant to the integrator, for nothing.

Bender does not know about the DPI backend, so the simulator needs it listed by hand. It is the
C++ in [this directory](.), and it needs C++17:

```sh
vlog -ccflags "-std=c++17 -O2" <cva6>/test/hw/tracer/*.cc
verilator ... <cva6>/test/hw/tracer/*.cc
```

Two modules are instantiated per core, in this order, both parameterised with the same
`CVA6Cfg` and RVFI types the core was. [`cva6tb_soc.sv`](../cva6tb_soc.sv) is the worked example:

- **`cva6_rvfi`** turns the core's `rvfi_probes_o` into the retirement records, and is the one
  that costs simulation time. Its `rvfi_instr_o` and `rvfi_csr_o` go to the tracer; its
  `rvfi_to_iti_o` carries the trap `tval` and the branch outcome, which are not in RVFI itself.
- **`cva6tb_tracer`** takes those four, and `HartId`, which must be set per core: it is what
  names the default output file, so two cores sharing it would write over each other.

Nothing else is needed — no clock other than the core's, no reset sequencing beyond `rst_ni`,
and no file handling: `cva6tb_tracer` reads its plusargs and opens its output itself, at time
zero, and closes it at `$finish`.

### Triggers

Anything that can be switched on and off is delimited by a *window*, and every window takes the
same kind of trigger at each end:

| Trigger | Fires when |
| --- | --- |
| `1000` or `cycle:1000` | the cycle counter reaches 1000 |
| `pc:0x80000100` | the program counter is this address |
| `sym:main` | the program counter is this symbol's entry point |

The instruction meeting the start condition is inside the window; the one meeting the stop
condition is not. Both ends keep being evaluated, so a `pc:` or `sym:` trigger reopens the
window every time execution passes through it — which is what you want for tracing every call
to a function. A window with no start trigger is open from the first instruction, and one with
no stop trigger never closes.

```sh
# from the first instruction of main on
make verilator-run TRACER=1 HEXFILE=sw/out/hello.hex TRACE_START=sym:main
```

The closing summary reports how much was traced when a window was in play:
`41 instructions traced of 125 retired`.

### Symbol annotation

Off unless `+trace_symbols=` names at least one ELF file. With make it is on: `TRACE_SYMBOLS`
names the program's own ELF, beside `HEXFILE`, and the boot ROM's once that has been built,
except in the `legacy` format, which stays byte compatible with the old logs. It takes a space
separated list in their place, and `TRACE_SYMBOLS=` turns annotation off. Each
source may be written `<path>@<bias>`, and the bias is added to every address it contributes —
which is how an image assembled from several separately linked binaries is handled: name each
one with the address it was actually placed at.

```sh
TRACE_SYMBOLS="sw/out/hello.elf sw/out/loader.elf@0x80100000"
```

`header` mode, the default, prints an objdump style line whenever execution enters a different
symbol and leaves the instruction lines untouched:

```
000000008000018e <main>:
        873ns        863  M  000000008000018e  00000797  auipc     a5, 0x0                         a5  = 0x8000018e
```

`inline` mode appends `<name+0x..>` to every line instead, and `both` does the two together. In
the `trace` format, branch and jump targets are named as well while annotation is on.

Only code symbols are kept: `STT_FUNC` and untyped labels such as `_start`, and only from
sections that are both allocated and executable. That drops the many symbols living in debug
sections, and RISC-V `$xrv64i...` mapping symbols are skipped by name.

Annotation has its own window, so it can be narrowed independently of the trace itself with
`+trace_symbol_start=` and `+trace_symbol_stop=`.

A rejected option — an unreadable ELF, an unknown symbol in a trigger, a misspelled mode —
stops the simulation rather than quietly producing the wrong trace.

### Output formats

`+trace_format=` picks how a line looks. The tracer decides *what* to report — window, symbols,
decode — and a formatter decides how it is spelled, so a new format is one class in
[rv_format.cc](rv_format.cc) and a name in the factory, with nothing else touched.

| Format | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `trace` (default) | plain text in fixed columns, meant to be read |
| `legacy` | the format of `instr_tracer.sv`, for diffing against an older `trace_hart_*.log` |
| `spike` | byte for byte what `spike -l --log-commits` writes, for diffing against spike |
| `rvfi` | the same information in `rvfi_tracer.sv`'s spelling, for the `verif/sim/` converters |
| `binary` | fixed size records, for tools rather than for people |

### The trace format

One line per instruction, in these columns: simulation time, cycle, mode, pc, encoding (four
digits for a compressed instruction), disassembly, what the instruction changed, and the
registers it read. The mode is the privilege level and the virtualisation bit together — `M`, `S`,
`U` and `D` for debug mode, and `VS` and `VU` for code running with V set — because the privilege
level alone cannot tell HS from VS or U from VU. Every column before the sources has a fixed
width, with time and cycle right aligned, so the lines align in any editor.

Instruction lines are indented under the symbol headers, which start in column 0, so an editor
can collapse one function at a time. VS Code folds by indentation with no setting; in vim, a
fold expression that starts a fold at every header does it:

```vim
:set foldmethod=expr foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^[0-9a-f]'?'>1':'='
```

The disassembly is spike's (see *Instruction coverage*), with branch and jump targets written as
addresses, and named when symbols are loaded. The effects are spelled like this:

| Effect | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `a0  = 0x2a` | register written, and its new value |
| `a0  = 0x2a <- mem[0x80001000]` | loaded from that address |
| `mem[0x80001000] <- 0x2a` | stored there, at the width of the access |
| `mem[0xffffffc000001000 pa=0x80201000]` | an access whose physical address differs |
| `mtvec = 0x80000100` | CSR written, and its value after the write, see *CSR writes* |
| `taken`, `not taken, mispredicted` | outcome of a conditional branch |
| `mispredicted` | a jump whose target was mispredicted |
| `!! illegal instruction, tval 0x0` | an instruction that trapped instead of retiring, then the CSRs the trap wrote |
| `!! interrupt` | a line of its own, ahead of the first instruction of the handler, then the CSRs the interrupt wrote |
| `!! ecall from U` | an environment call, then the CSRs it wrote |
| `-- mtval = 0x0` | a line of its own: CSRs written in a cycle where nothing retired or trapped |

Values are hex with no leading zeros. The name of a register written is padded to the longest
name of its register file, so the `=` signs line up: `a0  = 0x2a` above `s10 = 0x2a`. Every trap
and interrupt contains `!!`, so a search for it lists them all.

The sources column follows the effects: the registers the instruction read, with their values,
as `a5=0x800001b1 a2=0x800001b6`.

**In VS Code**, [vscode/](vscode/) colors `.trace` files. It is a grammar and nothing else, with
no code and no build step, and it is installed by linking it into the extensions directory and
reloading the window. From `test/`:

```sh
ln -s $PWD/hw/tracer/vscode ~/.vscode/extensions/cva6-trace          # VS Code on this machine
ln -s $PWD/hw/tracer/vscode ~/.vscode-server/extensions/cva6-trace   # over Remote-SSH
```

The colors come from the active theme: the time in the plain text color, the cycle as a number,
mnemonics as keywords, the register written as a variable, memory accesses as strings, symbols
as functions, mispredictions as escapes, the pc and the addresses of symbol headers as types,
the encoding as a regular expression constant, a muted color in most themes, and `!!` lines as
errors. Comment colors are left to `#` lines.

### Commit logs

Both commit log dialects write two lines per instruction: the instruction, then its
architectural effect — privilege, PC, encoding, the register written and its value, and
` mem <addr>` / ` mem <addr> <data>` for loads and stores. The disassembly on the first line is
the one spike-dasm prints, pseudo-instructions and all, so neither needs a spike-dasm pass.

```sh
TRACE_FORMAT=spike
```

```
core   0: 0x0000000080000008 (0x6783031b) addiw   t1, t1, 1656
core   0: 3 0x0000000080000008 (0x6783031b) x6  0x0000000000005678
```

**Why there are two dialects.** They are not interchangeable, and neither is a superset. Real
spike prefixes *both* lines with `core   N: ` and left aligns the register as `x6  0x…`;
`rvfi_tracer.sv` omits the prefix on the effect line and right aligns as `x 6 0x…`. The
converters under `verif/sim/` were written against the second: `verilator_log_to_trace_csv.py`'s
`RD_RE` matches the `rvfi` effect lines and none of the `spike` ones. So use `spike` to diff
against spike, and `rvfi` to feed those scripts.

Traps follow the same split: `spike` writes `core   0: exception trap_illegal_instruction,
epc 0x…`, which is the wording the converters' `ILLE_RE` looks for, while `rvfi` writes
`ILLEGAL_INSTR exception @ 0x<pc> (0x<insn>)`.

In `spike` format the effect line follows spike's rules too: store data at the width of the
access, a `mem` read and a `mem` write for an AMO, a read only for `lr`, a write for `sc` only
when it succeeds, and CSR writes as `c768_mstatus 0x…` records, in spike's order. A trap, an
`ecall` among them, is the disassembly line followed by spike's `exception` line and, for the
causes that have one, its `tval` line.

### CSR writes

CVA6's `cva6_rvfi` keeps a copy of the CSR state alongside RVFI, `rvfi_csr`: for every register
its current value and whether it changed in this cycle. The tracer passes on each change, and
the backend attaches it to the instruction or trap of the same cycle that made it:

- A CSR instruction reports the CSR it names, with its value after the write, even when the
  write left it unchanged; the value is the one the CSR reads back as, WARL fields applied.
- A trap or an `ecall` reports what taking it wrote: `mcause`, `mepc`, `mtval`, `mstatus`.
- An `mret` or `sret` reports `mstatus`, and an FP instruction `fflags` when its flags change it.
- What the entry into an interrupt handler writes happens in a cycle where nothing retires; it
  goes on the `!! interrupt` line of the `trace` format, and with it the cause in `mcause`.

The counters, `mip` and `sip`, `dcsr`, and the views `sstatus`, `sie` and `fcsr` change on their
own or along with another register, so they are reported only when an instruction names them.
With V set, a supervisor CSR instruction writes the virtual supervisor CSR, which is the one
reported.

`rvfi_csr` covers the machine, supervisor, user, FP, debug and PMP registers, the counters, the
hypervisor and virtual supervisor registers, and the CLIC ones; see *Core RVFI changes it
depends on*. A write to a CSR outside it, such as `senvcfg`, shows in the instruction only.

Verbosity levels do not apply to either commit log dialect, whose shape is fixed, and symbol
header lines are suppressed for both because they would break a parser reading the stream. The
inline annotation form still works.

### The binary format

`+trace_format=binary` writes a 64 byte header and then one fixed size record per event, little
endian and naturally aligned. There is nothing to parse: a reader checks the header and indexes
into the rest.

```python
import numpy as np
rec = np.dtype([('cycle','<u8'), ('time_ns','<u8'), ('pc','<u8'), ...])
data = np.fromfile('trace.bin', dtype=rec, offset=64)
mispredicted = data[(data['flags'] & 0x09) == 0x09]     # resolved branch that missed
loads        = data[data['class'] & 0x01]               # no decoder needed
```

Each record carries a `class` byte saying what the instruction is — load, store, atomic, CSR,
branch, jump, compressed — written by this tracer's decoder. Without it a consumer would have to
reimplement RISC-V decoding just to count an instruction mix, which is the one thing a trace of
raw encodings cannot answer on its own. With it, a dozen lines of standard library Python
reproduce every number in the statistics report.

[`util/read_trace.py`](../../util/read_trace.py) is the reference reader and documents the
layout field by field; it also converts to CSV and dumps records in a readable form:

```sh
./util/read_trace.py trace.bin --info      # header and record count
./util/read_trace.py trace.bin --csv       # csv on stdout
./util/read_trace.py trace.bin --limit 20  # readable dump
```

Retirements and traps share one record shape, told apart by `kind`; a trap puts its cause and
`tval` in the `rd_wdata` and `rs1_rdata` slots. A CSR write, from version 3, is a record of its
own after the retirement or trap that made it, with the address in `csr` and the value in
`rd_wdata`. Fields keep their offsets across versions and
new ones come out of `reserved`, so a reader that checks `version` and `record_size` keeps
working — `class` arrived that way in version 2, and the reader reports it as unavailable on a
version 1 file rather than silently counting zero loads.

### Comparing against spike

[`util/cmp_spike_trace.py`](../../util/cmp_spike_trace.py) diffs a spike commit log against a
trace taken in `spike` format and reports the first place they disagree:

```sh
spike --isa=rv64imac_zicsr -l --log-commits prog.elf > spike.log 2>&1
make verilator-run TRACER=1 HEXFILE=prog.hex TRACE_FORMAT=spike TRACE_FILE=rtl.log
./util/cmp_spike_trace.py spike.log rtl.log
```

The two runs do not start in the same place — spike begins at its own reset vector while the
testbench goes through its boot ROM — so the logs are aligned on the first program counter they
have in common, or on `--start-pc`. Everything is compared: the disassembly, the registers and
memory, and the CSR records, with one allowance. Spike records `fflags` on every instruction
that raises a flag, RVFI only when the value changes, and the flags are sticky; a record that
repeats the value `fflags` already holds is left out on both sides. `--ignore-disasm` and
`--ignore-csr` leave the disassembly and the CSR records out. The script reports where it
aligned the two logs, then either `MATCH` with the number of instructions compared or the first
disagreement, with both sides of the offending instruction:

```
#3 diverges:
  spike 0x0000000080000008 (0x6783031b)  addiw t1, t1, 1656  [x6 0x0000000000005678]
  trace 0x0000000080000008 (0x6783031b)  addiw t1, t1, 1656  [x6 0x000000000000dead]
```

The exit status is 0 when they match, so it drops into a regression script.

One caveat on what this can check: spike and the testbench only agree if the program does not
depend on anything outside the core. The tests under `sw/tests/` write to the EOC register and
the simulation console, which bare spike has no model for, so they diverge as soon as they touch
one. Self contained programs compare cleanly end to end.

### Software timeline in Perfetto

[`util/trace_to_perfetto.py`](../../util/trace_to_perfetto.py) turns a `binary` trace into a
[Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev) trace showing what the software did: a flame chart of the
call stack, the mode over time, a track of traps and interrupts, and an IPC counter.

```sh
make verilator-run TRACER=1 HEXFILE=prog.hex TRACE_FORMAT=binary TRACE_FILE=trace.bin
./util/trace_to_perfetto.py trace.bin prog.elf -o trace.pftrace
```

Then open `trace.pftrace` at <https://ui.perfetto.dev>. Several ELF files may be given, for an
image built from more than one binary.

Everything it needs is already in the binary record, so this runs on a trace that has already
been taken and changing what is plotted costs a re-run of the script. The fixed records parse with
no work, they are in execution order, and the `class` byte carries what the instruction is, so the
conversion needs no RISC-V decoding. It requires binary version 2 for that byte.

Frames come from which symbol the pc falls in, which attributes the tail calls that are common at
`-O2` to the callee. The rules, in order: the record after a call opens a frame, a symbol already
on the stack closes frames until it is on top, and any other change of symbol replaces the top
frame. Traps open a frame of their own, so a handler nests inside the code it interrupted.

A trap frame opens on the first instruction of the handler, which is where CVA6 flags the trap,
or on the instruction after an `ecall`, which CVA6 reports as a retirement. It is named after
the cause: `irq machine timer`, `irq 31` for a CLIC interrupt line, `trap illegal instruction`,
`trap ecall from S`. The cause is the latest write of the register the handler reads, `mcause`
in machine mode and `scause` or `vscause` in supervisor mode, from the CSR records of a version
3 trace; a version 2 trace names an exception from its trap record and an interrupt plain `irq`.
`mret`/`sret` closes the frame when one is open — `sret` also *enters* supervisor mode during
setup in these tests.

The file is loaded with numpy in one call and the per record work is vectorised, since the points
where anything changes are a small fraction of a trace. Every pc is resolved to a symbol with one
`searchsorted`; the mode changes, trap points, IPC windows and mispredict count are computed
over the whole trace at once; and the frame state machine runs where the pc moves into a different
symbol, a trap is flagged, or the previous instruction was `mret`/`sret`, the top of the stack
already naming the current symbol everywhere else. The dtype it reads with is the one
`read_trace.py`'s docstring gives.

Symbols are read out of the ELF directly. Any symbol in an executable section is taken, since the
assembly in `sw/tests/` carries no `.type` directive, and RISC-V `$x`/`$d` mapping symbols are
dropped because they sit on top of real labels.

`--time-unit` chooses what the Perfetto time axis counts, cycles by default because that is
usually what one wants to read off a hardware trace; `ns` uses the record's simulation time.
`--debug-frames` prints the same frames as indented text, which is the quickest way to check that
the nesting came out right:

```
       273  <no symbol>
       614    _start
       830    main
      1016      enable_interrupt
      1267      wait
      2785      trigger_interrupt
      2862      wait
      4487    smode_entry
      4625      irq 31
      4625        stvec_handler_succeed
      4658        smode_pass
      4728          trap ecall from S
      4728            mtvec_handler_fail
```

[`util/perfetto_proto.py`](../../util/perfetto_proto.py) writes the trace. A Perfetto trace is a
bare stream of length delimited `TracePacket` messages, so the subset needed for tracks, slices
and counters is encoded here directly; field tags are constant and built once at import. That
framing is also why two traces concatenate into one: a second producer — in simulation probes,
say — can be merged in later as long as it takes its track uuids from a different range, which
`--uuid-base` exists for.

### Verbosity levels

`+trace_verbose` adds detail to the two formats meant to be read. In `trace`:

**1** and above — append the commit port and the retire counter as a comment, `# p0 #1161`.
Useful for dual-issue questions.

In `legacy`:

**0** — the legacy layout, nothing else. This is what you want when diffing against an older
`trace_hart_*.log`.

**1** — adds, per line: the data moved by loads and stores (`ST:`/`LD:`), the CSR touched by a
CSR instruction and the value written to it as RVFI reports it (`csr:mtvec <-…`), addresses for AMOs, the outcome
of a resolved branch (`br:taken`, `br:not-taken,mispredicted`), a `<- trap entry` /
`<- interrupt entry` marker on the first instruction of a handler, and a second line under each
trap carrying the short cause name and the raw cause register. A `#` header names the columns.

The branch annotation makes the trace answer branch questions on its own:

```sh
grep -o "br:[a-z,-]*" cva6tb_trace_hart_0.txt | sort | uniq -c   # with TRACE_FORMAT=legacy
   9607 br:not-taken
   1512 br:not-taken,mispredicted
  72853 br:taken
   2951 br:taken,mispredicted
```

**2** — additionally stamps each line with the commit port and the retire counter, `[p0 #1234]`,
between the encoding and the disassembly. Useful for dual-issue questions; not diff compatible.

## End of run statistics

`+trace_stats=<path>` writes a summary when the run ends. It is off unless a path is given, and
it goes to its own file, so the trace stays a trace.

```sh
TRACE_STATS=stats.txt
```

The collector in [rv_stats.cc](rv_stats.cc) *observes* the same retirements the formatter is
handed, rather than reading the formatted text. That keeps the numbers independent of which
output format is in use, and a second collector counting something else hangs off the same two
`record()` calls without touching the tracer or the formatters.

It reports instruction and cycle counts with IPC, the mode split, the instruction mix with
bytes moved, branch and mispredict rates, traps grouped by cause, and — when symbols are loaded
— which of them the instructions went to:

```
Branch prediction
  resolved control flow           86923   23.6%
  of those taken                  75804   87.2%
  of those mispredicted            4463    5.1%

Where the instructions went (38 symbols, top 15)
  vprintfmt.constprop.1           93937   25.5%
  _boot                           67670   18.3%
  hpt_init                        56085   15.2%
```

Statistics cover what was traced, so a window narrows them too. To get a summary without
keeping a trace, point the trace at `/dev/null` and only the summary survives.

## What RVFI cannot tell us

- **Mispredictions** are not part of RVFI. CVA6's branch unit resolves them into `bp_resolve_t`,
  and the branch mispredict probe (see *Core RVFI changes it depends on*) carries
  `is_mispredict` out alongside the `branch_valid` and `is_taken` that the probe already
  forwarded, on `rvfi_to_iti_t` rather than on RVFI itself. Leave
  `branch_valid_i` / `branch_taken_i` / `branch_mispredict_i` tied to `'0` and the column reads
  `0` everywhere, as it did before the probe existed.
- **Third source operands.** RVFI reports two source values. For the FMA instructions the third
  one prints as `----------------`. The same fallback covers the few CVA6 instructions whose
  scoreboard operand slots do not line up with the architectural `rs1`/`rs2` — mostly the FP
  ops, where the tracer matches decoded operands against the reported ones by register number
  and falls back to consuming them in order.
- **`tval`.** Not part of RVFI; taken from `cva6_rvfi`'s `rvfi_to_iti_o.tval`, which is
  registered in the same cycle as the RVFI outputs.
- **Floating point flags per instruction.** `rvfi_csr` shows `fflags` when it changes, so an
  instruction that raises a flag already set leaves no record, and when two FP instructions
  retire together the change goes with the first of them.

## A note on physical addresses

`rvfi.mem_paddr` used to be driven from [`store_buffer.sv`](../../../core/store_buffer.sv), which
made it meaningful for stores only — loads reported whatever address the last store had left
behind. It is now driven from the output of the translation stage in
[`load_store_unit.sv`](../../../core/load_store_unit.sv) and paired back up with its access
inside [`cva6_rvfi.sv`](../../../core/cva6_rvfi.sv), which delays the transaction id by the one
cycle the MMU and PMP stages take. Neither the RVFI interface nor the probe bundle changed.

## Instruction coverage

| Group | Covered |
| --- | --- |
| RV32I / RV64I, M, A, F, D, C | yes |
| Zicsr, Zifencei | yes, with CSR names |
| H (`hlv*`, `hsv*`, `hfence.*`) | yes |
| Zba, Zbb, Zbs, Zbc | yes |
| Zicond (`czero.eqz`, `czero.nez`) | yes |
| Zicbom, Zicboz (`cbo.*`) | yes |
| Zfh (half precision) | yes, via the format field |
| Zcb (`c.lbu`, `c.mul`, `c.zext.*`, …) | yes |
| Zcmt (`cm.jt`, `cm.jalt`) | yes, see below |
| Zkn (`aes*`, `sha*`, `pack*`, `brev8`, `zip`, `xperm*`) | no |
| V (vector) | no |

Zkn is enabled in `cv32a6_imac_sv32` and the `cv64a6_imafdc_sv39*` configurations; until the
decoder learns it, its instructions print as `INVALID`, apart from `clmul` and `clmulh`, which
share Zbc's encodings. Vector needs `vtype`/`vl` tracking to render sensibly.

Unknown encodings print as `INVALID` with the raw word still in the encoding column, so nothing
is silently dropped.

**Two spellings.** Every instruction above can be spelled two ways. `legacy` uses the legacy
tracer's: its columns, its operand order (`csrw t0, mtvec`) and the decompressed operands of a
compressed instruction (`c.j x0, 310`). The `spike` and `rvfi` formats use spike-dasm's: its
pseudo-instructions (`seqz`, `snez`, `sext.w`, `ret`), `zero` for `x0`, operands in assembler
order and pc relative targets (`c.j pc + 310`), and `unknown` for an encoding it does not know.
[rv_disasm_spike.cc](rv_disasm_spike.cc) is a table of the instructions with spike's match,
mask and operands, searched in spike's own order, so a pseudo-instruction wins over its base
instruction exactly where it does in spike. On RV32 it names `rev8`, which spike recognizes by
its RV64 encoding only.

**Zcmt needs a hint.** `cm.jt` and `cm.jalt` occupy the same encoding as `c.fsdsp`, and the two
are mutually exclusive by construction — a configuration has one or the other. The decoder
cannot tell from the instruction word alone, so the SV side passes `CVA6Cfg.RVZCMT` down to the
backend as an extension mask. Zcb needs no such hint because it only uses otherwise reserved
encodings.

CSR names cover every CSR CVA6 implements, named as spike names them, plus the CLIC and CVA6
specific ones spike has no name for, and trap causes cover the hypervisor codes. In CLIC
mode the cause register packs the saved interrupt level and privilege above the exception code;
the tracer masks those off and prints the raw value at verbosity 1.

## Core RVFI changes it depends on

Five bugs in CVA6's RVFI generation and four gaps in what it reports, found while building
this tracer. Each is its own commit — `fix(rvfi):` for the bugs, `feat(rvfi):` and
`feat: expose branch mispredictions in RVFI` for the gaps — so each can be reviewed, reverted
or sent upstream on its own.

- **Per access physical address.** `rvfi.mem_paddr` was driven from the store buffer's
  speculative queue, so it only ever described stores: a load reported whatever address the
  previous store had left behind, and the first load of a program reported zero. It is now
  driven from the output of the translation stage and stored per scoreboard entry. See *A note
  on physical addresses* above.
- **Interrupt cause bit on RV64.** The test was `ex_commit_cause[31]`, but the interrupt bit of
  `mcause` is its most significant bit — bit 63 on RV64. Every interrupt was therefore reported
  as a synchronous trap, with `rvfi.intr` tagged `'b11` instead of `'b101`. RV32 was unaffected.
- **Environment call from VS-mode.** CVA6 reports an `ecall` as a retirement rather than a trap,
  because the instruction does execute; it just transfers control. The list of causes given that
  treatment named machine, supervisor and user mode but not virtual supervisor mode.
  `riscv::ENV_CALL_VSMODE` already existed and was simply never added when the hypervisor
  extension landed.
- **Virtualisation bit.** `rvfi.mode` is two bits, so VS read as HS and VU as U, and the mode
  column could not tell virtualised code from the code hosting it: an `ecall` from VS mode was
  labelled as coming from S mode while `mcause` on the same line said 0xa. `cva6_rvfi_probes`
  now samples the core's `v` alongside `priv_lvl`, and `rvfi_instr_t` carries it as `virt`, held
  at zero in debug mode, which `mode` reports as CVA6's `2'b10` and where virtualisation has no
  meaning. It is a separate field rather than a third bit of `mode`, because `mode` is RVFI's
  own and means the privilege level.
- **Branch mispredict probe.** Not a bug, a gap. `cva6_rvfi_probes` already receives the whole
  `bp_resolve_t` and already forwards `valid` and `is_taken`; `is_mispredict` sits in the same
  struct and was never copied out, so nothing downstream could tell a mispredicted branch from a
  correctly predicted one — the legacy `instr_tracer` had that column and RVFI based tracing
  could not fill it. It travels on `rvfi_to_iti_t`, not `rvfi_instr_t`: a mispredict is not part
  of RVFI.
- **CSR values narrower than XLEN.** `cva6_rvfi` widened a CSR value with
  `{{XLEN - $bits(x)}, x}`, the concatenation of an integer with `x` rather than `x` padded with
  zeros, so `fflags`, `frm`, `fcsr`, `menvcfg`, `mcountinhibit`, `mstatush` and the PMP
  registers reported garbage above their width: `fflags` 0x10 read as 0x770.
- **The sie and sip views under H.** `csr_regfile.sv` builds them as `mie`/`mip` masked by
  `mideleg` and, with the hypervisor extension, further masked by `~HS_DELEG_INTERRUPTS`. The
  snapshot applied only the `mideleg` term, so it reported VSSIP, VSTIP, VSEIP and SGEIP as set
  in registers where a `csrr` of the same address returns zero.
- **Hypervisor CSRs.** `rvfi_csr` had none. It now carries `hstatus`, `hedeleg`, `hideleg`,
  `hcounteren`, `hgeie`, `htval`, `htinst`, `hgatp`, the `vs*` registers, `mtinst` and `mtval2`.
  The commit touches no CLIC code, so it applies ahead of the CLIC support.
- **CLIC CSRs.** Likewise `mtvt`, `mintstatus`, `mintthresh`, `stvt`, `sintthresh`, `vstvt` and
  `vsintthresh`, each as a read returns it, which is zero outside CLIC mode.

## Validation

- **Against the legacy tracer.** Under QuestaSim the legacy `instr_tracer` can be compiled in
  alongside this one with `LEGACY_TRACE=1`, so both write a trace for the same run. With the time
  and cycle stamps stripped, the two traces match line for line apart from the differences listed
  under *Deliberate differences* below. The cycle stamps differ by a constant offset: the legacy
  tracer counts from the core's internal reset, this one from the SoC reset, plus the RVFI
  register stage.

  To repeat the comparison, build with both tracers and strip the stamps. The two write to
  different files by default, so nothing needs renaming:

  ```sh
  make vsim-build TRACER=1 LEGACY_TRACE=1
  make vsim-run   TRACER=1 LEGACY_TRACE=1 HEXFILE=sw/out/clic_smode.hex TRACE_FORMAT=legacy
  cd vsim/build
  grep -vE "^Exception|tval:" trace_hart_0.log | sed -E 's/^ *[0-9]+ns +[0-9]+ //' > legacy.txt
  sed -E 's/^ *[0-9]+ns +[0-9]+ //' cva6tb_trace_hart_0.txt > new.txt
  diff legacy.txt new.txt
  ```
- **Against spike-dasm, encoding by encoding.** The spike spelling is checked against
  `spike-dasm` over every 16 bit encoding and over random encodings of every instruction in the
  table, with the register and immediate fields biased towards the values that select a
  pseudo-instruction, for RV64, RV32, and RV64 with Zcmt. The two agree everywhere except on the
  CSRs spike has no name for.
- **Against spike, instruction by instruction.** Self contained programs run both on real spike
  (`spike -l --log-commits`) and on the testbench in `spike` format agree on every instruction:
  same PCs, encodings and disassembly, same register writes, same memory effects, same CSR
  records, checked with `util/cmp_spike_trace.py`. One mixes integer, multiply, atomic, floating
  point and compressed instructions with loads, stores, branches and calls; another writes CSRs
  with every form of CSR instruction, takes an `ecall` and returns with `mret`. Corrupting one
  register value in the trace is caught and pinpointed.
- **The binary format against the text one.** The PC and encoding sequences read back from a
  binary trace are identical to the text trace of the same run, and the record count equals
  retirements plus traps. The instruction mix and branch statistics recomputed from the binary
  file alone, using only the `class` and `flags` bytes and no decoder, equal the ones the
  in-tracer collector reports.
- **RV32.** `cv32a6_imac_sv32` elaborates and runs with the tracer unchanged — the boot ROM
  happens to compile to identical code for both widths, so only the test software needs
  rebuilding with RV32 flags. `hello` passes and traces correctly, with the PC and VA columns
  narrowing to the 32 bit widths. An RV32 coverage file disassembles exactly as objdump does,
  including the encodings that differ between the two widths: `c.jal` rather than `c.addiw`,
  `c.flw`/`c.fsw` rather than `c.ld`/`c.sd`, and the RV32 forms of `rev8` and `zext.h`.
- **With virtual memory.** Accesses whose physical address differs from the virtual one report
  both, including the same VA resolving to two different PAs across a guest page table change,
  which is what the per-access address fix is there for. With the hypervisor extension in use,
  every hypervisor instruction form decodes, and the only `INVALID` line is an instruction guest
  page fault whose encoding is genuinely zero because the fetch never completed.

## Deliberate differences from the legacy tracer

- `amomaxu.w` / `amomaxu.d` are named correctly; the legacy tracer printed them as `amomax`.
- The RV64M 32-bit forms print as `mulw`, `divw`, `divuw`, `remw`, `remuw`; the legacy tracer
  appended a `w` to every mnemonic in the group and produced names like `mulhw`.
- CSRs the legacy tracer printed as a number, the CLIC ones among them, are printed by name.
- `csrs` and `csrc` are printed for the `rd == x0` forms. The legacy tracer listed both
  mnemonics but its `casez` ordering made the patterns unreachable, so it always said `csrrs`
  and `csrrc`.
- An `ecall` appears as a retired instruction. The legacy tracer printed only the
  `Exception @ ... Environment Call ...` line for it, because CVA6's RVFI reports environment
  calls as retirements.
- Interrupts produce no line at verbosity 0, where the legacy tracer printed
  `Exception @ ... Cause: ... Interrupt`. RVFI reports an interrupt on the *handler's* first
  instruction rather than on the interrupted one, so the tracer marks it there instead, as
  `<- interrupt entry` at verbosity 1. Moving that marker down to verbosity 0 is a one line
  change if the parity matters more than a clean diff.
- Exception lines stamp a plain nanosecond count instead of `%t`-formatted simulation time.
- Mnemonics and operands are derived from the encoding rather than from CVA6 scoreboard state.
  The rendering rules are the legacy ones, oddities included: `c.j` still prints as
  `c.j x0, <offset>` and `c.mv` as `c.mv rd, x0, rs2`, because that is the decompressed form the
  old tracer showed.
